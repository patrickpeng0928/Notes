When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you normally would.

Then, at any time, you can:

Create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more shells)

Kill existing windows

View a list of windows

Switch between windows - all windows run their programs completely independent of each other. Programs continue to run when their window is currently not visible and even when the whole screen session is detached from the user's terminal.

The interactive commands above assume the default key bindings. You can modify screenâ€™s settings by creating a ~/.screenrc file in your home directory. This can change the default keystrokes, bind function keys F11, F12 or even set a load of programs/windows to run as soon as you start screen.

To start screen automatically at login, set your .profile file to read:

exec screen

Attaching and Detaching
Once you have screen running, switch to any of the running windows and type Control-a d. this will detach screen from this terminal. Now, go to a different machine, open a shell, ssh to the machine running screen (the one you just detached from), and type: % screen -r

This will reattach to the session. Just like magic, your session is back up and running, just like you never left it.

Exiting screen completely
Screen will exit automatically when all of its windows have been killed.

Close whatever program is running or type `Exit ' to exit the shell, and the window that contained it will be killed by screen. (If this window was in the foreground, the display will switch to the previous window)

When none are left, screen exits.

This page is just a summary of the options available, type man screen for more.
